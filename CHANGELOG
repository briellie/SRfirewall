2.00 Alpha 2 - 04/11/2014
	- Slightly better documentation
	- Kernel module loading - 4/11/2014
	- The next two changes affect config files:
		- Add syn matching to acl.conf rules - this may break existing rules
		- Add syn and port/protocol matching to forward.conf rules - this will not
			break existing rules since it adds 4 new options at the end that can
			be omitted completely.
	- Fix some variable detection rules to be more reliable.
	- Fix some rule issues after real life stress testing.

2.00 Alpha 1 - 04/10/2014
	- Complete code rewrite and restructure to solve some long standing issues with v1
	- Separate out functions into support files for easier grouping of what they do
	- Make more compatible with multiple disto file layouts

=-=-=-=-= PRE 2.0 REWRITE =-=-=-=-=
1.1 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Reorder rules, place allow before block to allow overrides
	- Fixes for conntrack rules for better security (added -o/-i)
	- Correct some incorrect info in options.default

1.0 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Minor tweaks to various config files
	- Fix issue with tweaks loading
	- Version 1.0

0.9.14 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- IPv6 DHCP bypass rules (IPV6_LANDHCPSERVER)
	- Move FORWARD Established,Related rules to inside NAT rules, since without NAT,
	  we're not really going to need to track connections forwarding through the system.
	  I can probably be proven wrong if you don't use NAT but use the script for stateful
	  firewalling with non-RFC1918 IPs....
	- Cleanup work on code for v1.0

0.9.13 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Fix location of ipv6 fi statement, moved to end of ipv6 rules
	- Add default policy rules and IPV{4|6}_P{INPUT|OUTPUT|FORWARD} options
	  to control them.  Note the difference between BLOCKINCOMING and the PINPUT variable
	- Oops, looks like my state match of allowing NEW was undoing the incoming blocks.  Fixed.
	- IPV4_ALLOWED and IPV6_ALLOWED which will eventually replace TCPPORTS and UDPPORTS

0.9.12 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Change IPV6_ROUTEDCLIENTBLOCK so you can specify ranges to
	  block incoming to.
	- Add support for allowing IPV6 critical ICMP messages, on by default
	- Add support for interception of IPv4 packets, aka transparent proxy
	- Add beginning support for error checking of variable inputs, still not functional yet.
	- Test if we are using at least bash 3.x, since some of the more advanced features
	  we are using to make this script work don't work too well with bash < 3.0 or dash.

0.9.11 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Move some of the config clutter to conf/ - you can
	  put your config files anywhere, but by default, they're
	  now going to be in conf/
	- Beginning work on configuration tool.  If it ever
	  gets completed is a whole different story.  :)
	- Option to use state or conntrack module for state tracking.
	  By default, use conntrack.
	- After some research, we seem to not need NEW state match in FORWARD
	- Auto detect default gateway interface and IP of interface.  Has potential problems
	  if run before we've got a default interface, so manually define EXTIF to be sure, and
	  things should be okay.  This is mostly for people with dynamic IPs.

0.9.10 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Move clamp mss up earlier in the rules to possibly
	  fix an issue I noticed during testing
	- Move icmp allow code
	- Prevent duplicate icmp allow rules in NAT code
	- NETMAP support in NAT code

0.9.9a - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Minor bug fixes for my coding errors introduced in
	  the change of IPv6 variables

0.9.9  - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Loadable module support during firewall loading
	- More init script fixes.
	- Non-conntracked DNS reply packets allow options
	- Slightly improved IPv6 support to start to bring
	  it up to par with IPv4 support.
	- ipv6 marking support, changed ipv4 to use | instead of :
	- Renamed IPV6 variables, please read INSTALL file about conversion of config file
	  to new format.

0.9.8a - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Fixing executable file permission issues
	- Use /bin/bash in initscript cause dash does not recognize
	  more advanced methods that bash can use.  Oops.  Easiest
	  way to keep up to date is to symlink /etc/init.d/firewall-sosdg
	  to /etc/firewall-sosdg/doc/firewall-sosdg.init

0.9.8 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Almost at v1.0 quality for my tastes
	- BLOCK_(INCOMING/OUTGOING)_RFC1918 options to help sure up security of LAN space leakage
	- Changes to LANDHCPSERVER so it accepts interface names, plus a possible fix for win7
	  hammering DHCP server for unknown reason?
	- Cleanups
	- No longer display list of blocked IPs, considering if they are
	  as long as my list is, they'll take 4 pages to display...
	- New block file format, much more capable now, thanks to
	  an hour or two of improving my bash scripting skills to the
	  point where I can do more complex breakdowns of formats
	- Rename blocked to ipv4-blocked since we're going to have
	  ipv6 support
	- ipv6 blocking support.  Different format for config file
	  because IPv6 uses :, which means we get to use | for both
	  ipv4 and ipv6 (goes against a previous commit)

0.9.7 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Support for marking packets, uses new config file and
	  IPv4_MARK file option
	- MULTI-NIC-ARP-LOCK hack added, to fix what I consider to be an annoying 'feature' of
	  arp requests on Linux
	- Allow use of multiport iptables module to reduce amount of rules

0.9.6 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Minor changes to procedures in planning of 1.0

0.9.5 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Makefile to automate building tarball and for future use
	- More changes to port-forwards file to support source IP and external IP (existing
	  config _will_ be incompatible)

0.9.4 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Initscript
	- stop-firewall for...  stopping the firewall!
	- Code cleanups
	- Use of functions for some processes
	- Fix DHCP rule
	- Obsoleted NATRANGE, NATEXTIP, NATEXTIF
	- Added NAT_RANGE which can take SNAT/MASQ rules
	- Changed port forwarding rules to include external interface

0.9.3 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Misc tweaks and reorg
	- Custom command files

0.9 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Colorize output
	- Added outbound port blocking options

0.8 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- IPv6 Connection Tracking fixes
	- Strip ECN off of specific outbound packets

0.7 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- MSS Clamp on IPv6
	- MSS Fixes, yes, its ugly
	- Beginning support for bogons filtering and updater
	  script.  Does not work yet, so don't use.

0.6 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Fixed some potential ordering issues with NAT
	- Added file for blocked IPs, plus new config option

0.5 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Fixing ipv6 UDP firewalling rules
	- Fixing IPv6 client routing block rules
	- Added new IPV6LAN interface option

0.4 - Brielle Bruns <bruns@2mbit.com>
	- Added support for pre-run commands
	- Fixed several bugs with NAT commands
